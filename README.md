# 3D-Cloud-Fields
Code associated with Manon Huguenin's MSc thesis "Development and Validation of 3D Cloud fields using Data Fusion and Machine Learning Techniques"

This repository contains the main parts of the code developed for the purpose of the MSc. thesis "Development and Validation of 3D Cloud fields using Data Fusion and Machine Learning Techniques" by Manon Huguenin, defended in November 2018 at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA. The dissertation can be obtained by GeorgiaTech students or faculty members by searching the SMARTech website, or by anyone by directly contacting the author through Github.

This repository contains two folders, corresponding to Step #1 and Step #2 of the thesis, respectively. The given codes should not be considered as the exhaustive code developed for the thesis, but as the parts of the code sufficient to obtain the most important results presented in the thesis. 

All of the codes take as inputs data from NASA datasets, which are all referenced in the thesis dissertation. Such datasets are not included in this repository in order to limit its size, but can be freely accessed and downloaded online following the references. For the results presented in the dissertation, data corresponding to 4 dates (February 22 to February 25, 2011) was used. 

The code was developed and run using Matlab r2017b (Academic License). For any question or issue with running this code, contact the author directly through Github.
